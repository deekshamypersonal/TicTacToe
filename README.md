# Tic Tac Toe in Java

A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Java. This project provides a basic example of a n-player Tic Tac Toe game where players take turns to make their moves on a n*n grid.

The project follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and specifically adheres to the SOLID principles. The classes are designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy addition of more symbols and future enhancements.
